__Luthier: Dead fret:__

Dead frets usually happen because there is some interference in the tension and imbalance on the guitar necks or a problem with the vibration of the string. Loose Frets – A fret after the one your fretting is a touch high and is touching your string as it vibrates

https://yeabig.com/how-do-you-fix-dead-guitar-frets/

Dead frets are deceptive. If one fingers a note, pick the string, and they get no tone or a low buzzing sound, it means that the next fret up is the one that is giving them the trouble.

__Luthier: Intonation:__

When an instrument is properly intonated, all the open strings and every note on the fretboard sound at their correct pitches. If your guitar still sounds noticeably out of tune even after you've tuned the open strings, the intonation is off—that is, the instrument is out of tune with itself.

https://www.fender.com/articles/tech-talk/intonation-101

From the nut to the saddle is called the scowl length. Fender Tele should be 25.5. 12 3/4 from nut to 12th fret.

Try picking an open string that is tuned. Then hold down the 12th fret and that too should be tuned.

__Luthier: Relecing:__

When you get to the bare wood, soak steel wool in white vinegar overnight and apply...it "greys" the wood

Good comment: "Personally I don't like the look of a poly finished relic because it doesn't look natural. Poly isn't supposed to wear so for a poly finished guitar to wear like a lacquer finished guitar the only way it can get there is abuse or being altered. I'm not opposed to the relic thing but I don't think it comes off well via poly. Though plenty of 70's poly finished Fender's show wear but not the huge bare wood spots a lacquer guitar does where the strumming arm makes contact. If I was going to do it with a poly guitar I'd take the less is more approach and limit the relicing to chips around the edges, dings on the face and back and rusty hardware and deglossed plastic parts. BTW a good way to put some superficial chips in a guitar that doesn't look like an orbital sander attack is to whack it with your keys, though poly is pretty tough so that may not do much."

Good comment: "I'd rather mess around on stage, rehearsal rooms, etc. instead of putting a sander and a blowtorch to it. Eventually your guitar will get real wear and tear, not the fake one. But if you think you need it for street cred... Be my guest."
