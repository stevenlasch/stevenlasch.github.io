https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg/related?hl=en-US

2. Using chrome, install an extension called Chrome UA Spoofer

Image: sizes
For now, the web app still uses images of 640px and display them in a box 600px by 600px. 
But for optimum quality across devices, start with an image that is at least 1080px in both dimensions.

#### Instagram: Security

There are several things you can do to protect your Instagram account from being hacked:

Use a strong, unique password: A strong password should be at least 8 characters long and 
contain a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. 
Avoid using common words or personal information as part of your password.

Enable two-factor authentication: This adds an extra layer of security to your account 
by requiring you to enter a code sent to your phone in addition to your password when logging in.

Be cautious when clicking on links: Don't click on links in unfamiliar emails 
or direct messages, as they could be phishing attempts.

Don't share your login information: Don't give your login information to anyone, 
even if they claim to be from Instagram.

Use a secure network: Avoid logging into your account on public or unsecured networks, a
s they may be more vulnerable to hacking.
