    <h2>Glossary and Definitions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Checksum:</b> A checksum is a calculated value used to verify the integrity of data. It's a kind of "digital fingerprint" that helps determine if data has been corrupted or altered during transmission or storage. </li>
        <li><b>Latency:</b> Latency is the time delay between an action or request and the response it generates, measured in milliseconds (ms). It's often described as a "digital round trip" that data packets take from your device to a server and back again</li>
        <li><b>Spring DAO:</b> The Data Access Object (DAO) is a design pattern that abstracts the interaction with a database or other persistence mechanism. In the context of Spring, it simplifies data access operations and promotes loose coupling between the application's business logic and the data layer. Spring provides robust support for implementing the DAO pattern</li>
        <li><b>Spring JPA:</b> Java Spring JPA is a powerful tool that simplifies database interactions in Java applications. It combines the Spring framework's dependency injection and transaction management capabilities with the Java Persistence API (JPA), a specification for managing relational data in Java applications.</li>
        <li><b>Queue Service:</b> A Queue service is a message broker used for asynchronous communication and task distribution.</li>
        <li><b>UML:</b> UML, or Unified Modeling Language, is a visual modeling language that helps software developers visualize and construct new systems. It's not a programming language â€” it's a set of rules specifically for drawing diagrams.</li>
